## Getting Started

The first step is downloading and installing the [Nerves
SDK](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-sdk) from GitHub. See the
[README.md](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-sdk/blob/master/README.md)
for instructions.

Once the Nerves SDK has been installed, you can start your own Erlang projects
and build them in the Nerves environment. Look at the [demonstration
project](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-demo) for
a simple example. The Getting Started screencast below walks through the SDK
installation and the demo application build step by step.
