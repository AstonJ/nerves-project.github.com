title:  Intel Galileo now supported

Frank got an [Intel Galileo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Galileo) for Christmas.  Here we are a few days later, and Nerves runs on it!

For those of you who don't know, the Galileo is based on the [Intel Quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quark), a 400 Mhz x86 compatible system-on-chip.   The Galileo packages the quark in a board that is compatible with Arduino shields.

Assuming you're using Bake, in order to use Nerves on the quark, simply add the following line to your `Bakefile`:

```elixir
target :galileo, recipe: {"nerves/galileo", "~> 0.1"}
```

That should allow you to do:

```
$ bake system get --target galileo
$ bake toolchain get --target galileo
$ bake firmware --target galileo
```

Enjoy!
