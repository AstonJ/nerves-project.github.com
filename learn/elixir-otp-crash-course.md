# Elixir/OTP Crash-Course

The intent of this page isn't to be an exhaustive guide to Elixir and OTP.
There are lots of great books and Internet blogs that have already covered that space.
This crash-course is just enough to give you a taste for OTP concepts, especially as they relate to embedded systems, and direct you to firther resources to learn more.
