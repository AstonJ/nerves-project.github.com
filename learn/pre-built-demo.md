# Pre-Built Demo Firmware

Our plan is to make a pre-built "demo firmware" available for download, but it's not ready yet.
This will let you get started understanding what Nerves is without having to write any code.
It also allows you to validate that you have `fwup` installed properly and that your target hardware is working.

> TODO: Write this article. Want to help? Let us know on the #Nerves channel on the Elixir Slack!
