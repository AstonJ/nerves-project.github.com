title: Interfacing Erlang Applications to Embedded Linux
---
{% include JB/setup %}

The Nerves project will provide an easy-to-use API in Erlang to common 
I/O interfaces on embedded Linux platforms.

This is a work in progress. However, if you are interested in running an
Erlang node on a low power ARM-based board and don't mind dealing with a
few rough edges, this project could help.

## Getting Started

This project is being developed on the
[http://beagleboard.org/bone](BeagleBone). While much Erlang code should
work on other embedded Linux boards, this is the board that we are
using.
