## What is Erlang?

[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) is a programming language used to
build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on
high availability (5-9's). Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking,
e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime
system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault
tolerance.

## What is OTP?

OTP is a set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing
middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed
database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging
and release handling tools.

## What is the Nerves Project?

The Nerves project provides an easy-to-use API in Erlang for common
I/O interfaces and hard real-time processes on embedded Linux
platforms.

If you are interested in running an Erlang node on a low power
ARM-based board this project can get you started.

We are initially developing on the
[BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/bone), which provides both low
cost and high functionality.
