        Using a lean, custom cross-compiled linux, nerves boots directly to the battle hardened BEAM vm, starting your application in seconds.

        Most devices need to get on a network, get discovered, update firmware, and deal with i/o of various kinds.  You're not on your own.

        Cross-compliation can really be a drag.  We've put a lot of work into making it smooth as silk. We are working to get you from "mix new" to running code on your device in minutes.

Although nerves is still quite young and under very heavy development, it is already powering rock-solid shipping industrial products.  We expect to have all three areas ready for a wider audience by end of 2015.  In the meantime, if you are very hearty and interested in helping us craft nerves, please contact us on the __#nerves__ channel in the [elixir-lang slack community](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

Nerves is fully open source with a permissive (MIT) license.  Nerves uses Buildroot to provide Linux, so some portions of the foundation are licensed under the GPL.
